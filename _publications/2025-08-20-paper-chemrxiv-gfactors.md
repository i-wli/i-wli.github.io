Twist-angle engineering of van der Waals heterobilayers is promising for designing quantum materials. However, establishing a microscopic framework connecting the geometry of moiré superlattices to experimentally accessible observables has remained unexplored. Here we report how the twist angle in MoS<sub>2</sub>/WS<sub>2</sub> heterobilayers simultaneously shapes electronic, magnetic and dipolar responses. The moiré superlattice preserves monolayer spin-valley locking, whereas the long-range moiré potential traps electrons and holes in spatially separated stackings. The exciton g-factor is fixed by the local high-symmetry stacking, resulting in two discrete, opposite-sign Zeeman responses; the intrinsic electric dipole moment can be continuously modulated by the twist angle.
