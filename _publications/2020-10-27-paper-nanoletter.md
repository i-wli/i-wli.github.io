A novel strategy has been proposed to produce in situ Li<sub>2</sub>S at the interfacial layer between lithium anode and the solid electrolyte, by using an amorphous-sulfide–LiTFSI–poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) composite solid electrolyte (SLCSE). Besides retarding the decomposition of PVDF in CSE, the Li<sub>2</sub>S-modified interfacial layer (SMIL) also improves the wettability between lithium metal and SLCSE which in turn optimizes the lithium deposition process. Our density functional theory calculation results reveal that the migration energy barrier of Li passing through SMIL is much lower than that of Li passing through LiF-modified interfacial layer (FMIL) formed from the decomposition of PVDF. The as-prepared SLCSE shows a Li ionic transference number of 0.44 and Li ion conductivity of 3.42 × 10<sup>-4</sup> S/cm at room temperature, and the Li\||SLCSE\||LiFePO4 cell exhibits an outstanding rate performance with a capacity of 153, 144, 131, and 101 mAh/g at a current density of 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, respectively.
