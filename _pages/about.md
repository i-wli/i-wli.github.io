PhD candidate in theoretical chemistry at TU Dresden (with [Prof. Thomas Heine](http://theory.chm.tu-dresden.de/members.shtml?name=theine&set_language=en&lang=en)) and Marie Skłodowska-Curie ITN fellow ([2exciting](https://itn-2exciting.chm.tu-dresden.de)), I specialize in developing and applying high‑performance software for chemistry and materials science. 

My experience spans academia and industry: I contributed to commercial quantum chemistry software at [Software for Chemistry & Materials (SCM)](https://www.scm.com/) and collaborated within [DFG CRC 1415](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/chemie/sfb1415) and [HZDR-CASUS](https://www.casus.science/). My interdisciplinary and international experience includes research in chemistry, materials science, and physics across Germany, the Netherlands, France ([CNRS‑LNCMI](https://lncmi.cnrs.fr/)), and China (BUAA, Chinese Academy of Sciences-IEE).


Research Interests
======
During my doctoral research, I focus on:
* Structural and opto-electronic properties of twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructures
* Multiscale modelling, from classical force fields to electronic-structure methods
* Development and implementation of semi-empirical quantum-chemistry methods


Developed Packages
